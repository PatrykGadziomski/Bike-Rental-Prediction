# Bike Rental Prediction

The following project at the Stuttgart Media University is a student project to predict the rental of bicycles. To achieve this, basic and advanced methods of data science were used with a focus on regression.<br>

## Content

The project consists of three parts:
1. **Data Exploration**
    - Descriptive Statistics vs. Diagrams
    - Quality Issues
    - Analysis and Comments
2. **Data Preparation and Baseline ML Model**
    - Basline ML Model
    - Preprocessings & Evaluations
    - Final ML Model
3. **ML Models Optimization**
    - Basline ML Model
    - Optimizations
        - Algorithms
        - Hyperparameter Tuning
        - Feature Selection
    - results documentation and visualizations

## Data

To predict the rental of bycycles we use a structured dataset describing bike sharing data. The Method is regression. The udes data consists of 732 rows and 18 columns containing 15 features and 3 labels. For our case the main lavel to be used is `cnt` (number of bike rentals per day).
