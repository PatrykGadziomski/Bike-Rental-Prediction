The features "season", "hum" " and "weekday" have missing values
Because "hum" has a lot of missing values and outliers(229), we decided to exclude
this feature.
"Season" and "weekday" had only few missing values, so we detected the right value via the feature
"dteday". Because of the used function, weekday has now a new order. 

Instant was set to Index, to have a more chronical dataset and a better overview.

Windspeed had Outliers, we replaced them with the median value.

We excluded the Outliers of casual via the quantile function

With histogramms we could detect, which feature is skewed (only Windspeed seemed to be skewed).
Since we have under thousand samples is better to use the function PowerTransformation
